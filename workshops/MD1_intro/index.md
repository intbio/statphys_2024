# Workshop: Introduction to MD simulations

## Description
- Simple hands-on MD simulations in Python + Introduction to Gromacs
- Duration: 90 minutes
- Objectives: be able to 
    - Numerically solve simple equations of motion in Python
    - Understand basic algorithm of MD simulations.
    - Understand the organization of Gromacs
    - Understand force field and topology files
    - Prepare files for MD simulation runs
    - Perform energy minimization

## Jupyter notebook
- [simpleMD.ipynb](simpleMD.ipynb)
- [gromacs_intro.ipynb](gromacs_intro.ipynb)
## Required software and resources
- Access to a Jupyter notebook evironment with Python 3, MDanalysis, nglview and prody libraries
- Access to Newton cluster with Gromacs installed or install Gromacs at your local workstation. See [http://www.gromacs.org](http://www.gromacs.org)

## Learning resources
- Short Gromacs tutorial [https://github.com/intbio/MolModEdu/tree/master/GROMACS/beginner](https://github.com/intbio/MolModEdu/tree/master/GROMACS/beginner)
- Extended Gromacs tutorial [https://github.com/intbio/MolModEdu/tree/master/GROMACS/nucl](https://github.com/intbio/MolModEdu/tree/master/GROMACS/nucl)



## Assignments

Perform energy minimization of a protein in Gromacs.

1. Plot energy versus step.
2. Compare steepest descent, conjugate gradient and L-BFGS methods.

### Suggested problem sets
Each student should take a unique PDB structure  at his/her own discretion.

### Troubleshooting
- Consult with the seminar protocol/recording
- Ask questions in Slack
