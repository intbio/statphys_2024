# Workshop: Introduction to Docking

## Description
- We will outline basic methods of docking with AutoDock Vina using Open Drug Discovery Toolkit.
- Duration: 90 minutes
- Objectives: be able to 
    - Understand how to configure docking parameters
    - Convert pdb files to pdbqt
    - Perform docking with AutoDock Vina in Python
    - Understand and analyse docking results

## Jupyter notebook
- [analyse.ipynb](analysis.ipynb)
- [docking.ipynb](docking.ipynb)
## Required software and resources
- Access to a Jupyter notebook evironment with Python 3, MDanalysis, nglview and oddt libraries
- Access to Newton cluster with MDanalysis, nglview and oddt installed or install MDanalysis, nglview and oddt at your local workstation. See [https://oddt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/oddt.html](https://oddt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/oddt.html)

## Assignments

Perform protein-ligand docking.

1. Save protein and ligand PDB structures into different files (if need).
2. Configure docking parameters.
3. Perform protein-ligand docking via AutoDock Vina.
4. Calculate RMSDs for all conformations.
5. Compare results and visualize the best conformation.

### Suggested problem sets
Each student should take a unique PDB structure  at his/her own discretion.

### Troubleshooting
- Consult with the seminar protocol/recording
- Ask questions in Slack
