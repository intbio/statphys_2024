# Workshop: Introduction to NWChem

## Description
- We will outline basic methods of working with NWChem programm
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Objectives: be able to 
    - Understand how to run NWChem
    - Perform Hartree-Fock or DFT calculations
    - Analyze system energy, optimize geometry
    


## Jupyter notebooks
- [nwchem.ipynb](nwchem.ipynb).



## Required software and resources
- [NWChem](https://nwchemgit.github.io)
- Or use Newton cluster mol_model_course environment.

## Learning resources
- [NWChem manual](https://nwchemgit.github.io)



## Assignments

Take a simple molecule (no more than 10 atoms):


1. Optimize geometry and get its energy using restricted Hartree-Fock method
2. Try different basis sets (consult NWChem manual), make a plot of HF energy vs different basis sets.

### Troubleshooting
- Consult with the seminar protocol/recording
- Ask questions in Slack
